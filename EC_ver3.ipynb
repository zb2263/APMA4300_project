    "Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and understanding blook flow behavior in compliant, viscoelastic vessels is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical device design. Consequently, developing efficient and accurate computational methods can provide clinicians and researchers with valuable insights into disease progression, surgical outcomes, and personalized medicine. The frequency-domain spectral element method (SEM) offers a computational advantage over the traditional finite element method (FEM) while maintaining high accuracy for the purposes of application."
