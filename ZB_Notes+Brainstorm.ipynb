    "### Introduction notes: \n",
    "Why we care about modeling blood flow: \n",
    "- blood pressure and blood flow rate affect: Wall shear stress (how much friction blood puts on the vessel wall),  Wall tension (how stretched the vessel wall becomes)\n",
    "- Both of these are directly tied to diseases like: aneurysms (ballooning of arteries), stenosis (narrowing of arteries), +  other cardiovascular disorders\n",

    "Different types of blood-flow models\n",
    "- Lumped parameter models: treat parts of the circulatory system like simple circuits (fast + approximate)\n",
    "- **1D wave propagation models: treat blood flow along the length of an artery**\n",
    "    - **They can track pressure waves traveling down vessels (efficiant and clinically useful)**\n",
    "- 1.5D models: A mix of 1D with some extra features\n",
    "- 3D models: Full fluid simulations (Navier–Stokes equations) → expensive\n",

    "Two numerical methods:\n",
    "Finite Element Method (FEM)\n",

    "Viscoelasticity \n",
    "- Artery walls are viscoelasctic → store energy (like elastic materials) + dissipate energy (like a dashpot) + they show hysteresis (pressure diameter loops don’t match on the way up vs down) \n",
    "- No one had used the spectral element method to study blood flow in viscoelastic arteries\n",

    "- Develop a 1D nonlinear spectral element model for blood flow in viscoelastic vessels\n",

    "    - “Nonlinear” = keeps nonlinear fluid effects\n",
