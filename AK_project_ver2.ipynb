    "Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and understanding blood flow behavior in compliant, viscoelastic vessels is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical device design. Consequently, developing efficient and accurate computational methods can provide clinicians and researchers with valuable insights into disease progression, surgical outcomes, and personalized medicine. The frequency-domain spectral element method (SEM) offers a computational advantage over the traditional finite element method (FEM) while maintaining high accuracy for the purposes of application."

    "We apply an iterative FEM method: we apply time discretization and solve iteratively at each step. This is the logic that Lee and Kang<sup>1</sup> use in their paper, though the specific method was not given. We define preliminary functions to be called in the final FEM function: we first create a mesh (**4a**), then define global nodes (over all finite elements) (**4b**), then assemble global coefficient matrices (as opposed to element coefficient matrices) (**4c**), then apply boundary conditions (**4d**), and finally compute the residual needed to test for convergence (**4e**). For the iterative solver, we apply Newmark-$\\beta$ time integration and use a Newton-Raphson solver at each time step (**4f**). Finally, we compile a complete FEM solver (**4g**)."
